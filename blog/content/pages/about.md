# About me :wave:

In this blog I want to create articles about subjects that I have to deal with in my everyday life and I consider that I have a minimum of experience related to them. I try to write about interesting topics and explain them as simply as possible, according to the quote `"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."` 

I have a Bachelor degree in Computer Science and I have 3+ years of experience in the IT industry, currently working as a DevOps Engineer.
